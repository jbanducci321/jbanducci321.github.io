            <h2>What is HCI?</h2>
            <p>
                Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is the study of how people use computers and digital systems.
                The goal is to design interfaces that are simple, clear, and helpful.
            </p>

            <article>
                <h3>Why does this matter?</h3>
                <p>
                    Good HCI helps users finish tasks faster and with fewer mistakes.
                    Bad design can confuse users, cause frustration, and lead to errors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A famous example is the Three Mile Island Nuclear disaster, which was shown to, in part, be caused by
                    poor human-machine interface design.
